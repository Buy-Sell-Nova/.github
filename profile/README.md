<h1>Welcome to Buy & Sell NOVA!</h1>

Our website is the "go-to" thrift shop for Villanova students, promoting community and sustainability on our campus. Students can sign up for an account with their 'villanova.edu' email, then choose to buy items from other students as seen on the homepage, or post items they wish to sell, from unwanted dorm decor to old class textbooks. All transactions are handled through the app.
